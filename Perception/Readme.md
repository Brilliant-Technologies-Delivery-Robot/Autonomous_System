# Perception Branch

## Overview
Perception in our delivery robot. could be divided into two the modes in  which we use perception to do enterprise cutting-edge features and technologies.
The features ccould vary from safety stack features , modes and interactive features.

## Files Structure

### For different modes using the camera


- Face Tracking
The aim of this is to make the robot to move with respect to the detected face of the object. now it only moves lateral but sonner will have another DOF to move in it.

- Human Following From Scartch
The aim is to make the robot follow moving human and move with respect to it. could be beneficial as personal assitant ot whatever application.

- Human Following with Navigation Stack
The same aim of Human Following From Scartch but he have found out that it would be easier to utilize the nav stack to make the task and let the robot follow the human

- Longtudinal_Follow 
Simple test to test the moving behind a goal and it takes its feed as the depth from kinect camera.

- Kinect for Simulation
Files needed to add the kinect to the simulation in gazebo and make the frame well-prepared and stuff like that.

- building_editor_models
Files used in worlds or worlds that could help to simulate in gazebo in general not only for perception.
